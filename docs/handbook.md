# Relay handbook

This is the durable operating and architecture reference for Relay. Start with
the [README](../README.md), use the [backend setup guide](../backends/README.md)
for installation, and read [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) before exposing a
backend outside a trusted network.

## Production deployment

Relay carries a bearer token on every API request and can start coding agents as
the backend OS user. A stable deployment should have all of the following:

- Terminate TLS at a named Cloudflare Tunnel or a reverse proxy such as Caddy or
  Nginx. A routable `http://` `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` triggers a warning but is not
  blocked.
- Keep `HOST=127.0.0.1` when the tunnel or reverse proxy is on the same host.
  Direct mode uses `0.0.0.0`; expose it only behind HTTPS and a firewall.
- Set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to the exact URL imported by clients. Regenerate and
  re-import credentials after it changes.
- Run Relay as a non-root user and restrict that user's filesystem access.
- Set `RELAY_FS_ROOTS` to the absolute directories the file API should reach.
  Without it, the API is filesystem-wide except for its built-in denylist.
- Generate one credential per device. Revoke and delete old device tokens rather
  than sharing one token.
- Keep `.env`, tokens, credential exports, CLI login state, push keys, history,
  sessions, settings, groups, quota state, and FCM service-account files out of
  git and release archives.

### Reverse proxy requirements

- Forward normal HTTP requests and long-lived SSE responses. Disable buffering
  for `/api/events`, `/api/chat`, and `/api/group/chat`.
- Forward `Upgrade`/`Connection` headers for the WebSocket endpoint
  `/api/terminal/connect`. Do not log its one-time `ticket` query value.
- Keep proxy timeouts above `AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS` (60 minutes by default).
- Pass the real client address in `X-Forwarded-For`. Relay trusts forwarded
  addresses only from loopback proxies.
- Match proxy body/response limits to Relay's defaults: 100 MB per upload and
  300 MB per download. Override with `UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` and
  `DOWNLOAD_MAX_BYTES` only when the full path can handle larger transfers.
- Narrow browser access with `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN` when the Web app has a stable
  origin.

Relay applies a general limit of 600 ordinary API requests per minute per IP.
Long-lived chat/SSE and file-transfer endpoints are excluded from that counter
but still require authentication. Failed bearer-token attempts have a separate
15-per-minute per-IP limit.

### File API boundary

The built-in denylist currently covers Relay's token file, `.env`, generated
credential directory, Web Push/FCM token stores, `~/.ssh`, Claude Code OAuth
credentials, and Codex auth. It is not a general secret scanner and does not
cover every third-party CLI configuration. Use `RELAY_FS_ROOTS` and a restricted
backend user for the actual production boundary.

Directory downloads are zipped and rejected if the tree would contain a denied
path. Native uploads/downloads stream; Web downloads use a browser Blob and may
hold the file in memory up to the configured cap. Unix directory downloads call
the host's `zip` command; Windows uses PowerShell `Compress-Archive`.

## Credentials and agent login

`npm run credential` creates an encrypted `relay.credentials.v1` QR/JSON
envelope containing the backend URL, machine identity, and one revocable device
token. It uses PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (600,000 iterations) and AES-256-GCM. The
passphrase is prompted for interactively and is not saved. Unattended setups can
supply it with `--passphrase` or `RELAY_CREDENTIAL_PASSPHRASE`, at the cost of
exposing it to shell history, the process environment, or a launcher/config file.

Useful commands from `server/`:

```bash
npm run credential
npm run credential -- --url https://relay.example.com
npm run credential -- --list-tokens
npm run credential -- --revoke <token-id>
```

The app can scan a QR on supported mobile platforms or import it by image/file
and pasted JSON. Native clients use platform secure storage. The Web client is
subject to browser-origin storage security, so use a private profile on a
trusted device.

Generate a different credential for each device. **Machine details** (tap the
machine in the drawer or on the home page) lists their token ids, device
metadata, and last-use time. Revoke a token before
deleting its record; revocation also closes the terminal owned by that token.
Generating another credential removes old export files but does not revoke
tokens that were already issued.

Relay reports separate installed, authenticated, and usable state for all four
known agents. Claude Code and Codex are the primary integrations; OpenCode and
Hermes are experimental. Every agent's credential or provider configuration is
created on the backend host with that CLI's own flow. Relay never logs a CLI in
remotely.

Claude's `claudeAiOauth.expiresAt` in `~/.claude/.credentials.json` is reported
as `credentialExpiresAt` (epoch ms) on `/api/agents`, and the app turns it into
the days left or the days since expiry on **Machine details**. Codex is
different: managed ChatGPT auth automatically rotates its short-lived ID and
access tokens, while the refresh token has no client-readable deadline. Relay
therefore always reports a null Codex `credentialExpiresAt` and shows no login
countdown for it.

Stored Codex state distinguishes managed ChatGPT, API-key, external-token, and
host-managed provider modes. An explicit **Recheck** calls `account/read` with
`refreshToken: true` on Relay's shared Codex app-server; a missing account or a
rejected refresh marks Codex as requiring authentication, while a transient
probe failure is reported as a check error and leaves the app's displayed state
in place.
Only normalized auth/status fields leave the backend: account identity and
credential values are discarded. Separately, `server/lib/usage.js` reads the
Claude/Codex OAuth tokens for quota reporting and can refresh an expired access
token atomically in the CLI's credential file.

## SSH terminal

**Machine details → Enter SSH** opens an interactive PTY on the backend. It
uses the backend service account's login shell, starts in that account's home
directory, and is presented by the same Flutter terminal emulator on mobile,
Web, and desktop. The colors follow Relay's current Light/Dark theme. Terminal
text uses the bundled `RelayTerminalMono` family, backed by Cascadia Mono, with
system monospace fallbacks for missing glyphs. Keep the bundled family as the
primary font: xterm measures its character grid before painting, and Chromium
can otherwise measure a proportional fallback and produce excessively wide
horizontal cells.

On Android and iOS a key bar below the terminal adds the keys a phone keyboard
lacks: Ctrl, Shift, Esc, Tab, and the four arrows. Ctrl and Shift latch: a lit
modifier applies to the next key, typed on the soft keyboard or tapped on the
bar, and then releases, so Ctrl then `c` sends `^C`; tapping it again cancels.
Esc, Tab, and the arrows send at once. Combinations such as Shift+Tab or
Ctrl+Left are encoded by xterm's keytab, exactly as from a hardware keyboard.

An authenticated `POST /api/terminal/ticket` returns a random, single-use ticket
valid for 30 seconds. The client redeems it at `/api/terminal/connect`; the
long-lived bearer credential is not sent in the WebSocket URL. One token record
maps to one PTY. Returning to Machine details leaves that PTY alive, and the
next Enter SSH reconnects to it; opening it elsewhere replaces the old socket
instead of creating another shell.
Revoking the device token closes the socket and PTY. Revocations made by the
credential CLI are picked up by the terminal heartbeat without a server restart.

Detached PTYs expire after 12 hours and retain up to 2 MB of output in process
memory for replay; terminal transcripts are not written to disk.
Operators can tune these bounds with `TERMINAL_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (60 seconds to 7
days) and `TERMINAL_BUFFER_MAX_BYTES` (64 KB to 16 MB), or select a shell with
`RELAY_TERMINAL_SHELL`. These settings do not make the terminal a sandbox: it
has the full permissions of the backend OS user and bypasses the file API's
denylist and `RELAY_FS_ROOTS`.

## Runtime model

### Agent sessions

No agent is re-spawned per turn. Each keeps a live CLI session that turns are fed
into, the way a terminal session works, so follow-up turns skip the cold start
and cancelling a turn interrupts it instead of ending the conversation. Claude
Code runs one Agent SDK process per conversation; OpenCode, Hermes, and Codex
speak stdio JSON-RPC (`acp` for the first two, `app-server` for Codex), where one
process per agent hosts every chat because each session carries its own workdir.

Every pool is only a cache. The resumable session id in
`server/agent-sessions.json` stays authoritative, so a chat whose process was
closed reloads into the same conversation on its next turn — the same behaviour
as before, just slower for that one turn.

Idle sessions are closed and there is a cap on how many stay live, because these
processes can be resource-intensive. See `RELAY_CLAUDE_*` and `RELAY_AGENT_*`
in `server/.env.example`. Defaults retain up to three Claude processes and four
live JSON-RPC sessions per agent, with a 15-minute idle timeout. Turns past a
cap wait for a slot.

Work an agent starts in the background now outlives the turn that started it,
except on Codex: its sandbox kills each command's process group as the command
returns, so background work there survives only if it detaches into its own
session (`setsid`). A Claude process with background tasks still running
(background subagents, Monitor, background shells) is not closed as idle, and
is evicted for the cap only when no other idle process can make room.

Deleting or clearing a conversation removes Relay's history and stored resume
id, then asks the pooled integration to remove its CLI-side transcript. That
last step is best effort because the external CLI can reject or fail deletion;
inspect the host's CLI state if guaranteed erasure is required.

### Workdirs, conversations, and settings

Each device stores its current workdir and sends it in `X-Workdir`. Backend state
then uses two related scopes:

| State | Scope |
|---|---|
| Named conversation, history, running turn, native CLI resume id | `workdir + agent + sessionId` |
| Model, effort, permission, fast mode | `workdir + agent + sessionId` |
| Swarm list | workspace in `X-Workdir` |
| Swarm transcript and member sessions | Swarm id plus its chosen work tree |

An agent context supports up to eight named conversations. `Main` preserves the
legacy scope key and cannot be deleted. Turns in one exact conversation scope
queue; other sessions can continue independently. Devices on the same scope
share backend history and live events. A new session starts from a copy of the
settings of the session it was created from; a session with no settings of its
own (one created before settings were per session) follows Main's until its
first change.

Agent controls are capability-aware:

| Agent | Model | Effort | Permission | Fast | Authentication |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Claude Code | yes | yes | yes | yes | OAuth |
| Codex | yes | model-specific | yes | yes | OAuth |
| OpenCode | yes | yes | yes | no | host-managed, optional key |
| Hermes | host config/pins | no | yes | no | host-managed key |

Fast mode defaults off, may use more quota or cost more, and is visible only in
the solo-chat composer. Relay sends an explicit Claude `fastMode` setting or
Codex `serviceTier` on every turn. Availability still depends on
the selected model, CLI version, account, and provider. Swarm storage can retain
the field, but the current Swarm form exposes only model, effort, and permission.

Claude settings are fixed for the life of its per-conversation SDK process, so
a change restarts that process and resumes the same conversation. OpenCode and
Hermes settings apply over ACP without restarting their shared process. Codex
applies model, effort, and service tier per turn; changing its sandbox reopens
the thread while resuming the same conversation, without respawning the shared
app-server process.

Codex model and reasoning choices come from the installed CLI's structured
catalog and keep each model's advertised order/default. Updating Codex clears
the discovery cache. Other agents use their supported live or fallback catalogs;
local pins may be added in the gitignored `server/models-extra.json`.

### History, search, and export

Relay keeps raw chat messages in `server/chat-history.json`, capped at the most
recent 200 messages in each conversation or Swarm scope. This file is backend
state, not an encrypted archive, and can contain prompts, agent output, and
sensitive project context. Protect it and any backups with the same care as the
backend account.

The client can search the current workdir across named sessions and agents, or
limit the search to the current agent. The backend returns at most 50 matches;
the client can jump to and highlight a result. Markdown export covers the
current conversation. Search snippets and exported Markdown pass through
Relay's targeted token-pattern redaction, but that filter is not a general
secret scanner and does not alter the raw stored history.

### Swarms

A Swarm is one canonical transcript above several independent CLI sessions.
Each workspace can store up to 20 Swarms, with up to eight members in each.
When a human message mentions multiple members, Relay snapshots the transcript
once, builds a speaker-labelled delta for each member, and runs those members in
parallel. Each member still serializes against its own private Swarm session.

Members can summon each other. A member's prompt lists the other members and the
`@name` that reaches each, and any of those names in its reply hands them the
floor: the round continues with another wave, snapshotted after the previous
replies so the newly summoned members see them. `RELAY_SWARM_MAX_HOPS` bounds how
many agent-driven waves follow the human's message (default 3; set 0 to keep
summoning human-only), because two members that keep naming each other would
otherwise run — and bill — without end. A member cannot summon itself, and a
turn that failed or was cancelled summons no one.

At creation, a Swarm selects its work tree and per-member model, effort,
permission, nickname, and prompt/persona. The work tree cannot be changed later.
Swarms can be cleared, updated, deleted, or saved as reusable JSON templates.
Templates contain the name, member list, and member configuration; they omit the
machine-specific workdir, id, and transcript.

### Quota and notifications

The usage screen reports Claude Code and Codex. It queries each source on its
own (`GET /api/usage?source=claude|codex`; an unknown source is a 400), so one
card fills in as soon as its source answers. Reset detection and
scheduled messages support Claude Code and Codex only. A schedule stores one
prompt per source and workspace for the next detected five-hour reset.

Claude's five-hour window only exists while it runs: once it lapses the usage API
reports no reset time, which the app can only show as unknown. The backend keeps
the window cycling by sending one minimal Claude Code request (one output token)
whenever the window is idle, then sleeping until just after the new reset
moment. It is enabled by default, is billed like an ordinary provider request,
and can consume quota. Set `ENABLE_CLAUDE_KEEPALIVE=false` to turn it off and
accept the unknown state; `CLAUDE_KEEPALIVE_MODEL` overrides the model used for
the ping. Codex quota discovery likewise sends a minimal Responses request to
obtain rate-limit headers and can consume quota. Both usage paths may refresh
the host's OAuth access token.

Notification delivery has three layers:

- Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows can show local notifications while Relay is
  receiving live events; Web can use browser notifications.
- Optional Web Push reaches a subscribed browser after the tab closes.
- Optional FCM reaches configured Android builds after the app is killed.

Linux desktop currently falls back to an in-app message. Fully killed iOS apps
do not have a configured offline push channel in this repository.

## API map

All HTTP `/api/*` endpoints require the imported bearer token. The terminal
WebSocket upgrade requires the short-lived ticket created by its HTTP endpoint.

- Metadata/auth: health, client auth status, agents and their auth state, agent
  options/settings/version/update, diagnostics, device tokens, and shared events.
- Chat: chat, cancellation, history, history search/export, and clear session.
- Named sessions: list/create, set active, and delete.
- Files/workdir: current workdir, recent workdirs with chat history, absolute
  directory browse, upload, and download.
- Swarms: list/create, update members, delete, history, clear, chat, and cancel.
- Quota: usage (all sources or one), schedules, schedule replacement, and
  cancellation.
- Push: browser subscription/config and FCM device registration.
- SSH terminal: authenticated ticket creation plus the WebSocket PTY transport.

The route implementations in `server/routes/` are the source of truth when an
endpoint changes.

## Development and builds

### Backend and Web

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```

On Linux, `node-pty` compiles a native addon during `npm install`; install
Python 3, `make`, and a C++ compiler first (for example `build-essential` on
Debian/Ubuntu). macOS and Windows use the package's supported prebuilt binaries
when available. Unix hosts also need `zip` for directory downloads.

To let the backend serve the Flutter Web client:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build web --no-pub --pwa-strategy=none --no-web-resources-cdn
npm --prefix server start
```

The server serves `build/web` when present. CanvasKit is bundled locally and the
service worker is disabled to keep the self-hosted client current.

### Desktop clients

Desktop runner projects exist for Windows, macOS, and Linux, but each target
must be built on its own operating system. Windows release builds have been
exercised in this repository; macOS and Linux runners still need broader
release/secure-storage validation before being advertised as packaged releases.

```bash
flutter run -d windows       # or macos / linux
flutter build windows --release
```

Build prerequisites:

- Windows: Visual Studio with Desktop development with C++, Windows SDK, CMake,
  and Flutter. Use an ASCII-only repository path. The repository already adds
  the MSVC coroutine compatibility define needed by the notifications plugin.
- macOS: Xcode, command-line tools, CocoaPods, and Flutter desktop enabled.
- Linux: clang, CMake, Ninja, pkg-config, GTK development packages,
  `libsecret-1-dev`, and a keyring such as GNOME Keyring.

Typical artifacts are `build/windows/x64/runner/Release/`,
`build/macos/Build/Products/Release/Relay.app`, and
`build/linux/x64/release/bundle/`. Packaging, store signing, macOS notarization,
and production Android signing are not configured. Android release builds in
this repository still reuse debug signing.

## Configuration

### Refreshing application icons

`assets/icon.png` is the transparent master. After replacing it, run
`dart run scripts/generate_icons.dart` from the repository root to export the
Android, iOS, macOS, Web, and Windows assets. The Windows ICO includes 16, 24,
32, 48, 64, 128, and 256 pixel images. iOS and maskable Web exports use an opaque
navy background; other exports retain the master's transparency. Rebuild each
client to embed its new assets.

### Backend settings

`server/.env.example` documents supported deployment settings. The most useful
groups are:

- identity/network: `PORT`, `HOST`, `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, tunnel variables;
- execution: `RELAY_DEFAULT_DIR`, `AGENT_TIMEOUT_MS`, `PROMPT_MAX_BYTES`,
  `RELAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY`, `CODEX_HOME`, `RELAY_TERMINAL_SHELL`, and terminal
  idle/buffer limits;
- agent sessions: `RELAY_CLAUDE_IDLE_MS`, `RELAY_CLAUDE_MAX_LIVE`,
  `RELAY_CLAUDE_BIN`, `RELAY_AGENT_IDLE_MS`, `RELAY_AGENT_MAX_SESSIONS`;
- Swarms: `RELAY_SWARM_MAX_HOPS`;
- security/files: `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN`, `RELAY_FS_ROOTS`, upload/download caps;
- usage: quota watch, poll interval, HTTP/probe timeouts and backoff;
- offline push: VAPID keys and `FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE`.

The default workdir for a new device is `~/Relay`;
after first use, each device persists its own selection.
