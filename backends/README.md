# Backend setup

[中文](README.zh-CN.md) · [Deployment handbook](../docs/handbook.md#production-deployment)

Relay uses the same Node.js server and HTTP/SSE API on every backend host. The
files here only adapt dependency setup, process management, logs, and optional
Cloudflare Tunnel startup to each operating system.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer.
- At least one supported CLI installed on the backend: Claude Code, Codex,
  OpenCode, or Hermes.
- Every CLI must be authenticated or configured on the backend host itself.
  Relay reports status but does not perform OAuth login or collect provider
  keys.
- Unix hosts need `zip` for directory downloads. Linux setup also needs PM2,
  Python 3, `make`, and a C++ compiler for the terminal PTY dependency.
- `cloudflared` is required only for named or Quick Tunnel mode.

## Install

Run one command from the repository root:

| Backend OS | Command | Service manager |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | `./backends/linux/setup.sh` | PM2 |
| macOS | `./backends/macos/setup.sh` | per-user LaunchAgents |
| Windows | `.\backends\windows\setup.ps1` | per-user Scheduled Task |

The setup script creates `server/.env` when needed, installs server packages,
configures the selected network mode, starts the service, and runs the
credential generator. Import the generated `.relay.png` or `.relay.json` in the
app and enter the passphrase you chose.

### Network modes

1. **Direct:** use your own reachable address. The server binds to `0.0.0.0`;
   put HTTPS in front before exposing it publicly.
2. **Named Cloudflare Tunnel:** use a stable hostname in a Cloudflare zone. The
   server stays on `127.0.0.1`.
3. **Cloudflare Quick Tunnel:** useful for a trial. The generated
   `trycloudflare.com` URL may change after restart, so regenerate and re-import
   the credential when it rotates. Find the new URL in the service logs, then
   run `npm --prefix server run credential -- --url https://NEW-URL` from the
   repository root.

## Service management

### Linux

```bash
./backends/linux/status.sh
./backends/linux/start.sh
./backends/linux/stop.sh
./backends/linux/uninstall.sh
```

These wrap PM2, which remains available directly:

```bash
pm2 list
pm2 logs relay-server
pm2 restart relay-server --update-env
pm2 logs relay-tunnel
```

Linux setup requires PM2 (`npm install -g pm2`). It creates `relay-server` and,
for tunnel modes, `relay-tunnel`. Logs are under `~/.pm2/logs/` as
`relay-server-*.log` and `relay-tunnel-*.log`. `uninstall.sh` removes the PM2
processes and leaves backend data, tokens, and credentials in place. The
interactive terminal's PTY dependency is
compiled on Linux, so first-time setup also needs Python 3, `make`, and a C++
compiler (for example the Debian/Ubuntu `build-essential` package). Install
`zip` as well if clients will download directories.

### macOS

```bash
./backends/macos/status.sh
./backends/macos/start.sh
./backends/macos/stop.sh
./backends/macos/uninstall.sh
```

LaunchAgents are installed under `~/Library/LaunchAgents`. Logs are under
`~/Library/Logs/Relay/` as `backend.*.log` and `tunnel.*.log`. The generated
service PATH includes common Homebrew and per-user binary locations.

### Windows

For release 0.1.7, `relay-backend-windows-x64-v0.1.7.zip` includes the Node.js
runtime, npm, and locked production dependencies. Extract the whole ZIP to a
permanent writable directory and run `.\setup.cmd` from PowerShell there.
Agent CLIs and optional `cloudflared` must still be installed on the host.
The bundle's `README.md` explains setup and updates; `.\start.cmd`,
`.\stop.cmd`, `.\status.cmd`, `.\credential.cmd`, and `.\uninstall.cmd` wrap the
same service adapters below. The Scheduled Task starts at this user's login.

```powershell
.\backends\windows\status.ps1
.\backends\windows\start.ps1
.\backends\windows\stop.ps1
.\backends\windows\uninstall.ps1
```

Logs and PID files live under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Relay\logs\` and
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Relay\runtime\`. If PowerShell blocks the setup script, allow it
for the current shell only:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

All three uninstall adapters remove the managed service but deliberately leave
configuration, tokens, credentials, histories, and logs for manual cleanup.

## Manual server start

For development or troubleshooting, bypass the service adapters:

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```

Authenticate the chosen agent CLI on this host, then generate a credential
separately with `npm run credential`. See
`server/.env.example` for configuration and the handbook for production
hardening.
