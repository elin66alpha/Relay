# Changelog

## 0.1.3 - 2026-06-27

### Added

- First-run **Deploy backend** guide in the app, with Linux, macOS, and Windows
  setup commands and the same credential-import flow as the README.
- Background turn tracking for single-agent sessions, so long-running turns can
  continue while the user moves between sessions.
- Running-session indicators in the CLI agent drawer.
- More public-facing README structure, a dedicated security model, and release
  preparation documentation.

### Changed

- New-session creation no longer blocks just because another session is running.
- Credential import screens now surface scan, upload, and paste flows more
  clearly across mobile, Web, and desktop.
- Flutter and backend package metadata are bumped for the 0.1.3 release.

### Fixed

- Several chat/session state edges around switching sessions while work is still
  in progress.
- Documentation drift around production deployment and current version naming.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-06-20

## 0.1.0 - 2026-06-11

  state handling.
